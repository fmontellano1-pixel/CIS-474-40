## What’s inside
- `index.html` — Home with CTAs and status
- `plan.html` — Charter, WBS, schedule, risks
- `deliverables.html` — Phase items + Canvas notes
- `about.html` — Team & contact
- `css/styles.css` — Clean dark theme, responsive
- `js/script.js` — Mobile nav + active link
- `assets/` — Put PDFs (charter, reports), images, etc.
